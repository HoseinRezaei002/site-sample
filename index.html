                <p id="superFirstPara">TERN wasn’t built to chase AI trends; it was created to solve a real problem.
                    Co-founder and former
                    special operator Brett Harrison first saw the danger of contested GPS signals during military
                    operations in Afghanistan. Seeing those vulnerabilities grow from daily frustrations to national
                    security risks, he partnered with AI entrepreneur Shaun Moore, who led a team to built the world’s
                    fastest facial recognition system. Together, they united professional navigators and top-tier AI
                    engineers to create IDPS™, a signal-independent navigation system born from lived experience, not
                    theory. That foundation, paired with a culture of creative empowerment and mission-first thinking,
                    has enabled TERN to deliver a combat proven and U.S. Department of Transportation tested,
                    infrastructure-free alternative to GPS that is already reshaping how the world navigates.</p>
